## Swift Code Challenges

This is a set of computer exercises/Interview questions implemented in Swift.

Don't forget to **watch** the repository; Its content will be expanded and updated frequently.

## Motivation

When I was preparing for technical interviews I noticed an unfortunate lack of resources in Swift.
While in the other hand it was fairly easy to find examples or resources in almost any other programming language. It's gotten better but I feel there is still a lot to do. So I decided to share my solutions so hopefully I can help other people out there.

## Installation

Just download the **Swift Playgrounds** open them in **Xcode** and uncomment the function calls to have the code running.

## Contributors

**These are my solutions and result of my own experimentation and learning process**. If you have better, different or more Swifty like solutions you would like to share **open an issue** and please open a **pull request**.
