# Swift Code Challenges
##### programming exercises in Swift.
This is a set of programming exercises/Interview questions implemented in Swift 3.0.

Don't forget to **star** or **watch** the repository; Its content will be expanded and updated frequently.

## Motivation

When I was preparing for technical interviews I noticed an unfortunate lack of resources in Swift.
While in the other hand it was fairly easy to find examples or resources in almost any other programming language. It's gotten better now sites like interviewCake have Swift solutions but I feel there is still a lot to do. So I decided to share my solutions so hopefully I can help other people out there.

## Setup / Usage

Just download the **Swift Playgrounds** open them in **Xcode** and uncomment the function calls to have the code running.

Questions are organized by data structures. There is a playground corresponding to each data structure containing multiple questions.

## The Algorithms.

#### Strings
- Given an array of integers, find the highest product you can get from three of the integers.
- Write a function that counts the number of words in a camelCase string.
- Write a function that checks if a string is a palindrome.
- Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with ‘%20’.

#### Binary Search Tree
Insertion
- Recursion

Search operation
- Recursion
- No recursion

Depth First Traversal
- In-Order
- Pre-Order
- Post-Order

Breadth First Traversal
- Level Order Traversal

Questions
- Given a sorted array, create a binary search tree with minimal height

- Determine if a binary tree is balanced
